GoBoundedBuffer
===============

Bounded Buffer implementation using go. See documentation.

I am still relatively new to go when this is
being written so I am unaware of what structures
are best and/or necessary for this problem. I 
am using goroutines for asynchronus processes.
This project is based on an assignment 
I received in an operating systems course at Central
Michigan University.

TODO: Modify documentation to comply with godoc specifications. Use defer statements where appliciable.
